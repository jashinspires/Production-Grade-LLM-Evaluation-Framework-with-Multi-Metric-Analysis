{"query": "What is machine learning?", "prediction": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions."}
{"query": "Where is Mount Everest located?", "prediction": "Mount Everest is located in the Himalayan mountain range on the border between Nepal and Tibet (China). It stands at 8,848.86 meters, making it the highest peak on Earth."}
{"query": "What is the main function of the heart?", "prediction": "The heart's main function is to pump blood throughout the body via the circulatory system. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to tissues while removing carbon dioxide and other metabolic waste."}
{"query": "Who discovered penicillin?", "prediction": "Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum was killing bacteria in his laboratory."}
{"query": "What is the water cycle?", "prediction": "The water cycle is the continuous circulation of water through Earth's systems. It includes evaporation from water bodies, condensation in clouds, precipitation as rain or snow, and collection in oceans and groundwater."}
{"query": "What programming language was Python named after?", "prediction": "Python was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, the British comedy group. Creator Guido van Rossum was a fan of their work and wanted a short, unique name."}
{"query": "What is the difference between weather and climate?", "prediction": "Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind) at a specific time and place. Climate is the average weather pattern in a region over a long period, typically 30 years or more."}
{"query": "How does a vaccine work?", "prediction": "Vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen to the immune system. This stimulates the body to produce antibodies and memory cells, providing protection against future infections without causing the disease."}
{"query": "What is the theory of relativity?", "prediction": "Einstein's theory of relativity consists of special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915). Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant velocity and introduces E=mc². General relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass."}
{"query": "What is a black hole?", "prediction": "A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape. They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle, creating a singularity surrounded by an event horizon."}
{"query": "What are the three states of matter?", "prediction": "The three classical states of matter are solid (fixed shape and volume), liquid (fixed volume but takes container's shape), and gas (fills any container). There's also plasma, often called the fourth state."}
{"query": "Who was the first person to walk on the Moon?", "prediction": "Neil Armstrong was the first human to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during NASA's Apollo 11 mission. He spoke the famous words: 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'"}
{"query": "What is DNA?", "prediction": "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. It's structured as a double helix containing four nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C) that encode the instructions for building and maintaining life."}
{"query": "What causes seasons on Earth?", "prediction": "Earth's seasons are caused by its 23.5-degree axial tilt relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. As Earth orbits, different hemispheres receive varying amounts of direct sunlight, creating seasons."}
{"query": "What is the difference between RAM and ROM?", "prediction": "RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory used for temporary data storage while a computer runs—it loses data when powered off. ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile and stores permanent data like firmware that persists without power."}
{"query": "Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.", "prediction": "Supply and demand is an economic principle where prices are determined by the relationship between how much of a product is available (supply) and how much people want it (demand). High demand with low supply raises prices; high supply with low demand lowers them."}
{"query": "What is the significance of the Renaissance?", "prediction": "The Renaissance (14th-17th century) was a transformative cultural movement marking the transition from medieval to modern times. It revived interest in classical learning, produced masterpieces in art and literature, and laid groundwork for the Scientific Revolution."}
{"query": "How does artificial intelligence differ from human intelligence?", "prediction": "AI is designed to simulate human cognition but lacks consciousness and emotional understanding. AI excels at specific tasks with speed and precision, while human intelligence is more flexible, creative, and capable of abstract reasoning across varied contexts."}
{"query": "What is blockchain technology?", "prediction": "Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers. Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash linking to the previous block, making records secure and tamper-resistant."}
{"query": "What are the benefits of renewable energy?", "prediction": "Renewable energy benefits include reduced carbon emissions and pollution, energy independence from fossil fuels, job creation in clean energy sectors, lower long-term costs, and sustainability since sources like solar and wind are virtually unlimited."}
{"query": "What is the purpose of the United Nations?", "prediction": "The United Nations, founded in 1945, aims to maintain international peace and security, foster cooperation between nations, protect human rights, provide humanitarian aid, and promote sustainable development worldwide."}
{"query": "Explain how a neural network learns.", "prediction": "Neural networks learn through training on data. During forward propagation, inputs pass through layers of interconnected nodes. Errors are calculated by comparing outputs to expected values, then backpropagation adjusts connection weights to minimize these errors over many iterations."}
{"query": "What is the greenhouse effect?", "prediction": "The greenhouse effect is when certain atmospheric gases (CO2, methane, water vapor) trap heat from the Sun, warming Earth's surface. While natural and essential for life, human-caused increases in these gases are intensifying the effect, causing global warming."}
